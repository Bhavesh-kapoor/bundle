            <h2>In this task, we use HTML and CSS to develop a quiz app. I want to keep this as short and straightforward as I can.
For instance:
</h2><h2>The page can be separated into many sections for the user interface using HTML div elements, and the sections are given classes and ids to identify them. The names of the classes and Ids are selected such that they convey the function of each div.</h2>

<h2>The first "div" is for "result," which will be used to indicate whether the chosen response is correct or incorrect and the current state of the query.</h2><h2>
The second "div" is for the "question-container," which is used to hold and display the question text.
The third "div" is for the "option-container," which, as its name suggests, will include all four answer choices.

Like wise many section can be created and divided to develop quiz app</h2>
