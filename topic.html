            <h1>What is the technology? Its purpose / function? Major points / features ?</h1>
            <h2>The most fundamental component of the Web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It describes the purpose and organisation of web content. The appearance/presentation (CSS) and functionality/behavior (JS) of a web page are typically described
                using technologies other than HTML (JavaScript).</h2>
            <H1>Who developed it? When? Why? </H1>
            <H2>Tim Berners-Lee created the initial iteration of HTML in 1993. Since then, HTML has existed in a variety of forms. HTML 4.01, which became a recognised standard in December 1999, was the most extensively used version during the 2000s. Another
                version of HTML was rewritten as the XML language and is known as XHTML.</H2>

            <h1>What is future of HTML language?</h1>
            <h2>Every language develops and changes. HTML is still a valuable language for expressing content and driving the expansion of the Web. It's time for HTML to develop and grow so that it can enable forms that are both content- and layout-driven
                in sensitive locations. In a perfect world, HTML would have a more straightforward syntax and coherent semantics for content flow. In the same universe, non-conflicting custom tag sets would make it possible to capture unique application
                structure and offer it in a variety of forms as long as they were confined to present the information content in a way that the content consumer would find most appealing. This would entail the option to choose precise rendering in the
                sensory areas that are either driven by a content-driven form or a layout-driven form.</h2>
            <h1>Which are similar language to html</h1>
            <h2>Extensible Markup Language (XML), which lacks predefined elements, is a markup programming language similar to HTML. In contrast to HTML, XHTML is a markup language that is created using XML.</h2>
